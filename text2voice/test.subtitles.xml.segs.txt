in this video i will provide an introduction to the stata software 
so i assume that you have purchased the stata license you have downloaded the software and you have executed it and you're ready to get to learn stata 
so what you need to do 
here is download the program introduction to stata and then double click on it to open it or alternatively 
if you open stata you can go in file open and then open up this file 
the easiest way to learn stata is to try to open an existing program so this program is called xero introduction to stata dot do 
it has a dot dot extension which is the extension for stata programs 
so here we have the program which is the dot do file and here we have what we call an output window and how we get to write in the output window is if you click on this button here which is execute or do command and basically that would execute the program 
and this is what we're going to see here as the output window 
so today what i will talk about in this introduction to stata video is how to set up the data sets that we have how to explore the data how to edit the data how to export regression output and we will end up with creating log files 
the data set that i will use today is called wage1.dta so dot dta is the extension for data files 
so dot do was the extension for the program itself 
so introduction to stata dot do and the data files are dot dta extension so wage1.dta 
so the first thing to do is download 
the data set from the website and then store it somewhere on the computer and so for me 
this data is located in the folders on my c drive econometric slash data and so you need to change this part here in the program where the data is stored on your computer in order for you to be able to run uh this program so i also have changed here um 
i have used and set up a global directory so global and i'm calling this data directory because uh all of the data sets that i have are in this folder and i can call them from this folder and so later on when i want to use the data set 
i will use the use command and then here this is the data directory slash wage one and this wage one would be calling up this file wage1.dta so comma clear means that if there's any other file in the memory it's going to be cleared and rewritten with this file 
so now you can accomplish the same thing by just changing the directory here 
if you do a cd change directory and then i use this directory here and then you could just call it simply by saying use wage one comma clear so that would accomplish the same thing 
but i'm using a global statement here for the data directory 
there are a couple more things to mention here 
uh one of them is clear 
all that also clears everything that is currently in memory so that the program could be rerun multiple times by coming here and running the program and set more off just turns off uh the more button when the program is executed so these are some of the things 
so another thing that we can do here is um to create a log file to save the output so how we're doing 
this is by saying log using we're giving it a name and i currently call this the log file comma replace and so comma replace meaning uh 
if if this log file exists next time we run the program we're going to be replacing this file 
so this is useful because as we're running the program all of our results are going to be stored in the log file so anything that you see here in the output window is going to be stored in this log file that we can later read and and basically would have all of the results stored okay 
so this is basically how to set up the data so now let's go ahead and explore the data 
so the first thing that we would be doing uh is to describe the data and so so here in the output windows just to backtrack a little bit 
here's the log file that is starting to be created and it's saying this is where this the log file is going to be stored 
this is the name of the file that's the extension of the file and um basically every time we run a file here in the output 
we would see what has been done so as we're exploring the data if we execute describe 
this is what we are going to see 
these are all of the variables in the data set 
so here we have the variable names and typically here there are the labels for these variables 
however this data set in particular is not very well documented 
so we have the variable names being repeated here but oftentimes this would say something like um wage measured in dollars and that would be hourly waged education measured in number of years uh so something like that 
these labels are going to be like that so if we don't want to be looking at all of the data set we can actually um just describe a few variables of interest and here we would be describing wage education and experience and as you can see now we're just describing wage education and experience 
so this is much much shorter if we want to list and see the first few observations of the data 
what we can do here is use the command list and here we have wage and then education and experience in 110 means uh just the first 10 obs 
uh means from the first to the 10th observation and here's from the first to the 10th observation 
here we have wage education and experience uh 
so this is for the first person for the second person and for the third person 
if we want to see where the data is 
we can actually click on the data editor and we can actually also look in the data just like that um 
but we can also list it in the output window as well 
so the next thing is to come up with summary statistics and here we would use summarize uh 
if we use summarize 
we will get the summary statistics for all of the variables um and then we can also summarize uh only a few a few variables so here summarize summarizes pretty much all of the variables so what we see is the number of observations mean standard deviation min and max and if we are using summarize um of these three variables that we're interested in uh here's what we're going to have as far as mean standard deviation min and max and these are the output that we can actually provide in tables if we want a little bit more information on a particular variable 
we can use summarize then put the name of the variable wage common detail and here a lot more detailed statistics so we have the mean standard deviation 
we also have the percentiles the first from the first to the 99th percentile 
we also have the smallest and the largest values so sometimes we need to look into more details for a particular variable 
we can also provide summary statistics by group if we use tabulate a female 
this provides a frequency table for females 
so here we have a female equals one 
we have 252 observations and if female equals zero we have 274 observations 
these are the percent frequency and the total number of observations we we have here so 
now 
we can also summarize the data uh if female is equal to one uh so summarize the variable wage if female is equal to one notice here that we use the double equals sign if it's equal to one uh and we need to say which variable here 
so we're summarizing uh wage for females and this is the average wage for females or if we want to uh summarize for both males and females how we're going to do this uh using by sort females 
so here we're sorting the data by the variable female and then we will be summarizing wage 
so what comes with this command 
as far as output is we will summarize the wage if female is equal to zero 
this is basically the wage for males and then we will summarize the wage if female is equal to one 
so this is the average wage for females here 
the next thing that we can do now is uh edit the data so we can keep or drop variables and um so here we can use the command keep and these are all of the variables that we would keep here and so the rest of the variables are going to be dropped from the data or if it's going to be easier 
perhaps we can just drop a particular variable such as tenure and here we kept it but now we're dropping it 
so we we can also drop a particular variable if we no longer need it 
so another thing that we can do is drop if wage is less than 2. 
so if we have certain values for a variable that we want to drop we can use this command so notice that while keep and drop here refer to the variable itself or to the columns in the data drop of wage is less than 2 would actually delete certain observations in in data that have wage less than two 
so it would delete certain rows in the data 
so the next thing we can do is we can actually label the variables because again this data set in particular was not very well labeled 
so we can put label variable and then we can say the name of the variable and then how we want it to be labeled 
so here we could put hourly wage in dollars and you see now 
when we use describe wage 
we can see wage here and then this is the label of of the wage so the nice thing about using dta files with stata is that not only that the variable names and all of the values of data are stored like an excel file 
but it also has this other useful information such as variable labels 
the next thing we can do here is we can generate new variables so that is done with the command generate or gen for shorter 
so here we can generate log wage which would be equal to log of wage 
we can also generate education squared which would be equal to education to the power of two or we can generate a region called southwest by summing up south and the west uh the observations that are in the south and in the west 
so this is a way to just generate new variables 
so the last thing we are going to do here is export regression output because sometimes it's useful to do that if we need to create tables so um these um lines 
here uh 
i have put a star in front of them 
so anything that has a star in front of them is commented out so stata is not reading it 
so here we would need to do it only one time and this would mean to install the outreg2 package and so if we remove the star in front of these commands here we we would be installing this outreg 2 package 
so actually we need to remove the star here and execute this line only once 
so this ssc 
install 
uh this would be installing the outreg 2 package and this package actually later on 
we could be calling it so that we can generate a nice table so 
i'm going to put the star back on here because i have it installed on my computer so again you need to do this only once 
so how are we going to do that the first thing is let's estimate a simple regression model so the way we're doing 
this is by using reg or regress and here wage is the dependent 
variable and education is the independent variable 
so reg of wage and education would estimate the regression model and the regression model is given here and so here we have wage dependent variable education 
the independent variable this is the coefficient that we have here so it means for one additional year of education 
the wage would increase by 53 cents so there are a lot of also additional uh statistics here from this table that we will be discussing later on but for now we're just interested in exporting results in tables 
so here's how we're going to do this 
we will call this outrigger2 package 
then we will say using and i'm giving this file name 
i'm going to call it a regressiontable.doc and here comma replace if we have any file 
we would actually be replacing this file and so then let's say that now we want to estimate the multiple regression model so how we are going to do 
this is uh estimating a multiple regression model so now 
in addition to education 
we have an experience so here we're running a regression of wage which is the dependent variable education and experience which are independent variables and these would be the coefficients that we get from this model so let's export 
also these results in table and so we are going to be using outreg2 using the same file and if we put comma append here this is going to append to the um the previous file that we have so again 
these are nice tables that get generated that could be used later on um later on 
so the final thing that we we could be doing 
here is uh log close and if you remember we opened the log file before and now we're closing it so everything that was actually done in this output 
uh window here was saved in this log file so if you go on your computer where the data files are where where currently the programs are you could actually see this log file in there and you can basically save all of this regression output here 
so this was a very quick introduction to stata thank you very much for watching and please see the other videos
